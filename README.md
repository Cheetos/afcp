# Algorithms for Competitive Programming

In this repository you will find the solution for the exercises in the book and the algorithms in the appendices. Also we will frequently update the content with solutions for problems that we consider interesting. At this point the topics covered in the book are the following:

* Fundamentals (Recursion and bitwise)
* Data Structures
* Sorting Algorithms
* Divide and Conquer
* Dynamic Programming
* Graph Theory
* Geometry
* Number Theory and Combinatorics 
* String Manipulation

The goal of this book is to have in one place the algorithms that are frequently used in competitive programming, providing a brief description of the algorithms along with a source code to reinforce the learning. We know is impossible to list all existing algorithms, but this book is a good start.

Part of the future work for this book consists on:

* Separating the "Number Theory and Combinatorics" in two different chapters.
* Add a section for optimization algorithms.
